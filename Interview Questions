1. What is an open port?
An open port is a network port on a device that is actively listening for incoming connections. It means there is a service or application running on that port and it is ready to accept communication from other devices over the network.

2. Why do attackers scan ports?
Attackers scan ports to gather information about a target system and identify potential entry points. This process is called reconnaissance, which is the first phase of most cyberattacks.

By scanning ports, attackers can:

Discover which devices are active

Identify running services

Determine software versions

Find vulnerable or misconfigured services.

3. Difference between TCP and UDP scan
TCP and UDP are two different transport protocols used for communication.

TCP Scan:

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is connection-oriented.
It establishes a full connection using a three-way handshake:

SYN

SYN-ACK

ACK

In TCP scanning, tools like Nmap send a SYN packet to check if the port responds. If the port replies with SYN-ACK, it means the port is open.

UDP Scan:

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless.
There is no handshake, so the scanner sends packets and waits for a response or timeout.

4. What is the role of a firewall?

A firewall acts as a security gate between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network (like the internet). Its main role is to monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules.

Firewall functions:

Block unauthorized access

Allow only required services

Filter malicious traffic

Protect against port scanning.

5.Why Wireshark?
Wireshark is a network packet analyzer used to capture and inspect network traffic in real time.

Wireshark complements port scanning because:

Nmap shows which ports are open

Wireshark shows what actually happens on the network

Using Wireshark, we can:

See TCP handshakes

Analyze SYN packets

Inspect data being transferred

Detect suspicious traffic
