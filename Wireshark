1.What is Wireshark?
Wireshark is an open-source network protocol analyzer used to capture and analyze network traffic in real time.
It allows users to inspect packets at a detailed level for troubleshooting and security analysis.
Packet Monitor:There are color codes for each type of packet. The packets are shown with the following information : 
1.Source IP address
2.Destination IP address
3.Protocol (TCP, UDP, HTTP, etc.)
4.Packet length
5.Packet number
6.Source port (if applicable)
7.Destination port (if applicable)
8.Hexadecimal dump
9.ASCII/text content (if readable)

2.Wireshark can color packets based on rules that match particular fields in packets, to help the user identify the types of traffic.
Light blue → TCP traffic
Light green → HTTP traffic
Black/Red → TCP errors or retransmissions
Purple → DNS

3.Flitering Commands:-
tcp - Shows only tcp packets.
udp - Shows only udp packets.
ip.addr == ip - Shows packets from or to this IP.
ip.src == ip - Shows packets only from this source IP.
ip.dst == ip - Shows packets only to this destination IP.
tcp.port == 80 - Shows HTTP traffic.
tcp.analysis.retransmission - Shows retransmitted packets.
tcp.flags.syn == 1 - Shows SYN packets (used in TCP handshake).
http - Shows HTTP packets.
dns - Shows DNS packets.

4.Important Wireshark Features
Follow TCP Stream → Reconstruct entire communication session
Statistics → Shows protocol hierarchy
IO Graph → Network traffic graph
Expert Information → Highlights warnings & errors
Export Objects → Extract files from HTTP traffic

5.Why Wireshark is Important?
Detect suspicious traffic
Analyze attacks (DoS, SYN flood, ARP spoofing)
Troubleshoot network problems
Monitor bandwidth usage

6.Conclusion
Wireshark is a powerful packet analyzer used for network troubleshooting, monitoring, and security analysis. 
Using filters effectively allows analysts to quickly identify relevant traffic and detect potential threats.
