1.What is Nmap?
Nmap is open source network scanning tool used for 
-> Host discovery
-> OS detection
-> Port Scanning
-> Service Version Detection
->Network Security Auditing


Basic Commands of Nmap:-
1.nmap <hostname or IP>  
rScans the target host and lists open ports and running services.
2.nmap -h
It shows the help section for nmap command.
3.nmap -sS -sV -O <Ip>
-sS flag is used for TCP SYN scan.
-sV flag is used for Detection of Service version.
-O flag is used for OS detection.
4.nmap -sS <Domain Name>
-sS flag is used for TCP SYN scan
5.nmap -sS <Domain Name> -oG <file-path>
-oG flag can be used to store the nmap result in to specific file.
6.nmap -sU <Domain Name>
-sU flag is used with nmap to perform a UDP scan.
7.nmap -sn <Domain Name>
-sn flag is used with nmap to perform a ping scan, which sends ICMP requests to a target host or network to determine hosts is up or not.
8.nmap -p 80 443 21 <Domain Name>
-p flag is used with nmap to perform scan on a specific port or range of ports.
9.nmap -A <Domain Name>
-A indicates aggressive, it will give us extra information, like OS detection (-O), version detection, script scanning (-sC), and traceroute (--traceroute).
10. nmap -sC <target>
Runs default NSE(nmap scripting engine)
11. nmap -Pn <target>
Skips hosts discovery.
12.nmap -T4 <target>
T used as thread to adjust scan speed.
T0 -> slow
T5 ->quick
